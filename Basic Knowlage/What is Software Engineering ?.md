Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering approaches to the development operation and maintenance of software It combines computer science principles and engineering methods to create reliable efficient and scalable software solutions

**Key Phases of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

1. **Requirements Gathering** Understanding what users need
2. **System Design** Planning architecture and components
3. **Implementation** Writing actual code
4. **Testing** Verifying software works correctly
5. **Deployment** Releasing software to users
6. **Maintenance** Updating and fixing software over time

**Software Development Models**

- **Waterfall Model** Sequential linear approach
- **Agile Methodology** Iterative and incremental development
- **Scrum** Framework within Agile with sprints
- **Kanban** Visual workflow management
- **DevOps** Integration of development and operations

**Core Principles**

- **Modularity** Breaking software into independent modules
- **Abstraction** Hiding complex details
- **Encapsulation** Bundling data and methods together
- **Reusability** Creating components that can be used multiple times
- **Scalability** Designing for growth and increased load

**Software Engineering Activities**

1. **Software Requirements** Defining what the software should do
2. **Software Design** Creating architecture and interface designs
3. **Software Construction** Actual programming and implementation
4. **Software Testing** Unit testing integration testing system testing
5. **Software Maintenance** Bug fixes updates and improvements
6. **Software Configuration Management** Version control and change management
