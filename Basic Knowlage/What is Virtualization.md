Virtualization is a technology that creates virtual versions of physical computing resources such as servers storage networks and operating systems It allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine sharing its hardware resources

**Key Components**

- **Hypervisor** Software that creates and runs virtual machines
- **Host Machine** The physical computer that runs the hypervisor
- **Guest Machine** The virtual machine created by the hypervisor
- **Virtual Hardware** CPU memory storage and network interfaces allocated to VMs

**Types of Virtualization**

1. **Server Virtualization** Multiple virtual servers on one physical server
2. **Desktop Virtualization** Virtual desktops hosted on central servers
3. **Network Virtualization** Virtual networks independent of physical hardware
4. **Storage Virtualization** Pooling physical storage into single virtual storage
5. **Application Virtualization** Running applications in isolated environments

**Benefits**

- Cost savings through hardware consolidation
- Improved resource utilization
- Faster deployment and scalability
- Better disaster recovery and backup
- Isolation between environments

**Common Virtualization Platforms**

- VMware vSphere
- Microsoft Hyper-V
- Oracle VM VirtualBox
- KVM Kernel-based Virtual Machine
- Citrix Hypervisor

**Use Cases**

- Data center consolidation
- Development and testing environments
- Cloud computing foundation
- Running legacy applications
- Security sandboxing

Virtualization is fundamental to cloud computing DevOps practices and modern IT infrastructure enabling efficient flexible and cost-effective resource management
